File Format:
- Configuration matrices
- Hodge numbers (h^{1,1}, h^{2,1})
- May include additional geometric data

Data Contents:
Each entry typically contains:
- Configuration matrix defining the CICY
- Hodge numbers
- Euler characteristic
- Other topological invariants

License/Terms:
- Publicly available data
- No restrictions on use for research
- Must cite original papers

Notes:
- DO NOT MODIFY original files
- This is a much smaller dataset than KS (7,890 vs ~474M)
- Excellent for sanity checks and baseline experiments
- Files are kept as downloaded for reproducibility
